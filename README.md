# Time Change Tracker

## Introduction
Time Change Tracker is an app that keeps track of the hours of operation for user-selected locations. If the operational hours change, the user is notified. This application utilizes Java and XML.

Ex. A user reguarly vists their local Planet Fitness gym. They are interested in using the Time Change Tracker app to stay updated on any changes to the gym's normal opeartional hours. The user adds the Planet Fitness location to the database by inputting the appropriate information for their location (e.g. street address). Planet Fitness is normally open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, the application notices that, due to an upcoming holday, this Friday's hours are not "open 24 hours" and notifies the user of the changes.

## How To Use The Application
